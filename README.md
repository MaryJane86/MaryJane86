- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marija, an enthusiastic junior developer with a growing passion for web development.
I'm excited to share my journey and projects as I learn and explore the world of coding.

- My Interests:
*JavaScript: I'm fascinated by JavaScript's versatility and power.
It's my go-to language for building interactive and dynamic web applications, and I'm always eager to learn more about it.
*Angular: I enjoy working with Angular for its structured approach to building single-page applications (SPAs).
It's a fantastic framework that helps me create scalable and maintainable projects.
*Web Development: From front-end design to back-end functionality, I'm passionate about all aspects of web development.
I aim to build user-friendly experiences that solve real-world problems.

- What You Can Find Here:
*Projects: A collection of my projects showcasing what I've learned in JavaScript, Angular, and other technologies.
These projects range from small exercises to more comprehensive applications.
*Learning and Experimentation: Code snippets, experiments, and prototypes where I test new ideas and concepts.
I'm committed to continuous learning and sharing my progress with the community.

Feel free to explore my repositories, provide feedback, and connect with me. I'm always open to collaborating and learning from others.
